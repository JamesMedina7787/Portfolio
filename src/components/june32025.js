  content:    `Kant offers a Progress Narrative premised on the rejection of pre-modern, unenlightened, tradition-based values. What he basically expresses in this passage is that you should know what’s right in your heart. So regardless of societal pressures and personal motivations, free will to work for a sense of duty for what you know is right should trump all. He states, “Thus the moral worth of an action does not lie in the effect expected from it and so too does not lie in any principle of action that needs to borrow its motive from this expected effect.” He puts it like a shopkeeper could practice good virtues in the eyes of the public, it does not count as good will though since it is done for monetary gain. This seems like a pessimistic glass half empty type of observation to me. People have an inherited upbringing. They model their hero’s, and sometimes we mirror the hero figures that guide us. This constitutes a lot of motivation why people would act as perceivably moral, not only in terms of expected value to them.

Kant expresses that moral requirements are categorical imperative. This creates a tension: If moral law is purely objective (categorical), then it seems to demand adherence regardless of motivation, but moral worth (good will) requires subjective internal motivation.

 I wonder how Kant would perceive these revolutionized AI days. In my opinion AI is a much better way of setting the protocols and moral structures of “What’s right or wrong”. Rogue internet information influences naïve people in sometimes dangerous ways, this seems unethical to me. Could this be corrected by a better unified internet under the powerful lead of Artificial Intelligence. Kan would be pleased to see that the spread of disinformation can be curbed by a unifying code of ethics.  It adheres to his desire for universal law. Kan would also be pleased to see that it is shared openly as to enhance the user’s capabilities and help contribute usefully to society, as to not waste such talents.

      My question would be what the best way is to decipher these morals. Could it be by vote or elected representatives? This debate directly relates to Kant’s principle of conformity to universal law.`
