In the course of 25SP Technical Ethics U4 this fall, one theme stood out to me more than any other; the ethical implications of technological advancement, especially as they relate to the world our children are growing up in. As a parent and someone who has witnessed the rapid evolution of technology first-hand, I found myself returning again and again to one question; how do we protect access in a monetized internet while keeping our culture and humanism intact? The discussions in this class, particularly those surrounding the philosophies of Kant, utilitarianism, and transhumanism, helped me frame my thoughts not only as a student, but as a father trying to carve out a better future for my daughter.
My favorite part of this class was the discussions. Whether we were talking about AI or technology against ethics, the format forced me to look at these issues through new lenses. At first, I felt like a news reporter covering the state of tech. But eventually, I realized I was documenting my own fears and dreams for the world my daughter will inherit. It is easy to get swept up in anxiety when facing the future, especially when it feels like corporations are in a race to extract every ounce of value from human attention. But through our readings, especially Quinn’s Ethics for the Information Age, I fight so desperately to use philosophy as a way to justify what we do as computer scientist. It gave me a moral language for the tug-of-war between innovation and fairness.
My final paper focused on the world of entertainment, which I chose because it reflects society through a lens I am familiar with; popular culture. That is how many of us have witnessed social change, from the early internet to the algorithm-driven platforms of today. Being 43, I have experienced multiple eras of technology and culture, and I realized I have a unique perspective that spans generations. It felt important to bring my scope into the discussions.
Engaging with ideas like transhumanism was completely new to me. I found myself thinking about the race for technological dominance and how it intersects with the decline of traditional work structures. We are transitioning from a world built on manual labor and routine careers to one that revolves around data, automation, and constant reinvention. At times, I admit, I feel hopeless. Like so many others, I have been affected by inflation, job instability, and the feeling that we are being left behind by the very systems we helped build. At times I dont even understand how I am surviving through this age of inflation; being that I am on the verge of homelessness and fighting so desperately to keep my head above water. But I try to stay optimistic, especially as a computer science student. I believe that those of us entering this field carry great responsibility. As Uncle Ben said in Spider-Man, “With great power comes great responsibility.”
Artificial intelligence is still in its infancy. In many ways, it is like a child, and we are its guardians. We must raise this digital child carefully, not just to serve the stockholders of big tech, but to serve humanity. AI should not become a cold tool for advertising and manipulation, especially not at the cost of our children’s attention and well-being. If we allow profit and speed to overtake ethics and foresight, we risk losing something essential, not just in tech, but in ourselves.
That is why utilitarianism gave me hope. At its core, utilitarianism is about maximizing well-being for the greatest good. That principle speaks to me, especially when I think of technology as a potential equalizer. The internet could still be a force for good, connecting people, expanding access to education, and amplifying marginalized voices. But when profit-driven algorithms determine what we see, and when companies monetize distraction instead of fostering connection, we fail to maximize happiness. We dilute human potential for the sake of clicks like I so thoroughly researched in my final paper.
What makes this moment so fascinating and so dangerous is that we are living in a true age of transition. It reminds me of Kant’s idea of Enlightenment as humanity’s emergence from self-imposed immaturity. The Enlightenment called for reason, freedom, and autonomy. But are we living up to those ideals? When corporations dictate visibility, when children cannot distinguish education from propaganda, when workers are priced out of basic access, we are not just failing people, we are failing the Enlightenment itself.
There is a quote in Quinn’s text that stayed with me: “We have to ask whether those with access are reaping all the benefits of the Information Age, while others are left behind.” That hits home. I have been on both sides. There were times the internet opened up worlds for me; learning, connection, opportunity. But I have also felt locked out, by lack of money, by hidden algorithms, by systems that were not built with people like me in mind. That is why the question of access is not abstract. It is personal. And it is one reason I want to help guide my daughter through this world and not become drowned by the problems that technological growth could instill upon us.
Despite the challenges, I remain optimistic. I truly believe this is the greatest time to be alive. We have tools our ancestors could not even imagine, and if we are brave enough to ask the right questions, we might find answers that change everything. I do not want my daughter growing up in a world of corporate surveillance and digital dependency. I want her to inherit a world where people fought for transparency, inclusion, and dignity. I want her to know that ethics matter, especially in technology.

This class did not just give me knowledge. It gave me vision. It reminded me that philosophy is not just about abstract theories, it is about how we live, how we lead, and how we raise the next generation. I may not have all the answers, but I am grateful for the questions I have learned to ask. As we move into a future shaped by code and commerce, my hope is that we do not forget our shared humanity. That is the only way we will ever build a future worth living in.
