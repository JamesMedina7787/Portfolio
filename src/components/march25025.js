  content:    `1) Of all the ethical frameworks we’ve studied, Stoicism makes the most sense in a world obsessed with social media ratings and panic trends. The Stoics taught that peace and virtue come from focusing only on what we can control. That’s exactly the mindset we need when talking about Artificial Intelligence. In 2012, people were convinced the world was ending because of the Mayan calendar.  I rolled my eyes more times that year than any other age of my life. I'm not a psychologist, but I know this must be a staple of human psychology; particularly the way that we loath change and have a hard time adapting to it. Right on cue all the doomsayers are on the AI wave. They talk like the terminator is chasing us all; guns blazing. Now it’s AI. Everyone’s ranting like the machines are about to rise up and suck our traditional lives away. But in reality, AI is just a better search engine—like Google with a brain boost. I didn’t panic—I went back to school for computer science actually because I heard what was going on with AI. I was a self taught coder and was intrigued by power of the tool. I figured this was the best time to make an official career out of my passion. That's what i think a Stoic would do: ignore the noise, take action, and use tech to improve life.

2) Stoicism and Wisdom Traditions in general show where procedural Enlightenment ethics fall short. Systems like Kantian ethics or Utilitarianism rely too much on rules or outcomes, but they don’t ask why we do things, or who we’re becoming in the process. For example, schools are panicking over AI being used to cheat, so they’re clinging to multiple-choice tests and lockdown browsers. But what are we even testing? 75% of the answers on those tests are nonsense. School and learning in general are better than these outdated systems of the education process. Meanwhile, I take notes in class and have AI narrate them using voices from my favorite movies. I pause, reflect, and ask questions—real learning that’s self-driven. That’s virtue. Not bubbling in a Scantron. Now the people who actually want to learn have ways of learning far better than before. If a few people get away with cheating should that stop innovation of our evolving brains and learning systems? Maybe the problem isn't AI. Maybe the problem is these Jurassic multiple choice tests. Maybe it's time to change the way we learn, test, and reward human learning. Its not like AI wont be available in the job market. They would fire you for not using it to work more efficiently. So why would we train like that? Let students choose how they want to learn and prove they understand. Education shouldn’t be a punishment for curiosity.

3) Quinn says Divine Command Ethics don’t translate across cultures—but we can honor pluralism by making space for different values. Take education again. Some people hate school. I worked with union guys who wanted nothing to do with it. That’s okay. Why force them into a system built for academics when they could thrive in hands-on fields? If they could get through school easier, focus on their crafts, and become better laborers so be it. Freedom to do what you want is the ultimate fix. If someone is truly into learning and becoming smarter, they can do that better too. That's great. A Kantian or Utilitarian model might try to force a one-size-fits-all outcome, but a culturally aware approach—some form of Cultural Relativism—would respect those choices and still provide structure. AI might just expose how broken the old model is. When education goes over the waterfall, onto the rocks, and the river of the future rushes on; may I dare to imagine a positive destiny afterwards. The world could possibly be flowing into a beautiful sunset. The world didn't end in 2012. Maybe the terminator will ultimately go down as what it was and nothing more; a good movie from a simpler time. The future doesn’t need to be feared. If we approach AI and education with virtue, intention, and flexibility, we might just find we’ve created a better world; not a broken one.`
